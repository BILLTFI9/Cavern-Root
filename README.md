## ðŸ“– Features
1. **Cavern Root**. It _generates naturally_ in most caves. Does not spawn in lush caves as the Glow Berries are enough for that biome.
2. **Twisted Cavern Root**. _Crafted_ from a single Cavern Root. It is edible and replenishes 3 hunger (1.5 chicken icons).
3. **Lumen Root**. A mutated Cavern Root found below y = 0. It also emits light.

### Expect improved versions!
